<h1>Gems of Wisdom</h1>
<ul id="gems">
	<li>Make circuits and wires neat, organized, and easy to access.</li>
	<li>Use voltage regulators (with heat sinks) for motors!</li>
	<li>Label wires with good tape that won’t fall off, and a decent marker that is easy to read and won’t smudge</li>
	<li>Keep a list of pin connections in one place</li>
	<li>Have team meetings to keep everyone up to speed</li>
	<li>Even if everyone can help each other out on various aspects of the project, delegate a manager to each aspect so that you know that somebody is responsible for getting it done.</li>
	<li>A lot of issues can be resolved by software, but getting the hardware right makes software much easier, and debugging a lot simpler</li>
	<li>If possible, the laser cutter at the machine shop cuts through thicker materials, much faster, and much neater. So supposing it isn’t broken, go use it.</li>
	<li>Prototype hardware, both in CAD and physically, to make sure that everything fits together and there is space for all the necessary components</li>
	<li>Do not try to hack Apple audio. The audio timing ratios are difficult to meet once everything is integrated into the Events and Services Framework. Or at least, get some help on this early on in the project timeline.</li>
	<li>Use an audio kit (Adafruit FX Sound Board, for instance) to output audio. Very easy to use and integrate.</li>
	<li>Check out www.eciaauthorized.com for components that are difficult to find.</li>
	<li>First, come up with a game that you are excited to play. Then, figure out how to meet project requirements. This order of brainstorming will hopefully result in a much more interesting final project.</li>
	<li>Buy your own wire cutters, wire strippers, and other basic lab tools and put your name on them. It’s a zoo in there.</li>
